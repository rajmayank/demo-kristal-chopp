                        Norfolk has been contested around the council table for the past three years. <span

                            to put the best interests of Norfolk County in the forefront and keep them there!</span>
                        Four years
                        ago, Norfolk was rudderless and headed for the rocks. Since 2010, the County had run deficits
                        every single year except 2012 and our reserve accounts had been completely depleted in order to
                        maintain tax and service levels artificially. Unfortunately, the piggy bank had completely run
                        out. I believe it will take another four years to complete a course correction and finally moor
                        the county in the safe harbour of solvency and prudent policy with an eye to common sense and
                        the long view. I'm a proven navigator with a firm hand on the tiller. <span

                            Norfolk where it needs to be!</span></p>

                            When staff move jobs within the corporation their old job is recorded
                            as a vacant position. Typically those staff are seeking new challenges
                            and opportunities for growth internally as opposed to looking for a job
                            elsewhere. </p>
                        <p>

                            In 2017, during the previous term of council, the vacancy rate (people
                            changed positions or left) was 429. In 2021, that number was 430, with the
                            majority of departures occurring in public health and long-term care.
                            <strong>Over
                                2018-2020, the number was much lower, ranging between 265 and 280.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HOWEVER, even during a time when everyone across all industries are
                            dealing with serious labour shortages, the number of employees who
                            actually exited the corporation through resignation, retirement, dismissal,
                            or targeted staff reductions was 13%.

                        <p>


                            Contrary to popular belief the <strong>County does not own RAB</strong>. The council back
                            in 2012 signed a 15 year lease for 1/2 of the building space for more than
                            $1 Million/year - an inconceivable $26.75sq/ft. By comparison the average
                            office lease rate in Toronto is $17.73! (Figure from Toronto Real Estate Board).</p>
                        <p>

                            Some may try to justify the lease rate claiming the County receives
                            taxes on a building we do not own but <strong>that is simply not true</strong> - the 2012
                            Agreement states that the owner is not required to pay any property tax
                            ($132k/year “forgiven”) on the portion of the building in use by Norfolk
                            County.</p>
                        <p>

                            Many have asked why the empty half of RAB couldn't have been used for
                            the <strong>Seniors Center</strong> or consolidation of staff. That's why! From a facilities
                            perspective this is the <strong>largest albatross around NC's</strong> neck and it will be
                            critical that the next council makes plans to exit from this facility when
                            the lease expires in 2027.</p>

                            <strong>No, I do not support closing another hockey arena.</strong> The tax payers
                            subsidized hockey nearly $2M per year but with the closure of the ice pad
                            at the REC center, <strong>it drove up usage at each of the other arenas and
                                made them all viable which is a really great thing!</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The closure also ensured <strong>the Seniors had a new home - mold free and
                                accessible</strong>. They have a robust docket of programming for more than
                            500 members and when not in use by the Seniors, facility usage by other
                            groups for other sports has been steadily increasing.</p>

                            <strong>Yes, change is hard</strong> and some of the adult leagues now have to play later
                            at night (just like the old days and typical of most municipalities today) but there is
                            still ice time available to meet the needs of all users in Norfolk
